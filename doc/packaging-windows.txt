How to package Naali on Windows
-------------------------------

Prerequisites:
- Have Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) from http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ installed
- Have an up-to-date MS Visual Studio 2008 Runtime Redistributable (vcredist_x86.exe) from
  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=A5C84275-3B97-4AB7-A40D-3802B2AF5FC2&displaylang=en
- Have OpenAL installer (oalinst.exe) from http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Downloads/Forms/AllItems.aspx
  (unzip oalinst.zip)
- Have up-to-date Naali binary runtime dependencies from the dependency svn (the "runtime_deps" directory)
  copied to your viewer "bin" directory.

Steps:
1) Copy the VS2008 redistributable (vcredist_x86.exe) and OpenAL installer (oalinst.exe) to your viewer checkout 
   root directory
2) Ensure that you do not have unnecessary files in your viewer "bin" directory. Own configuration files and
   compiled Python (.pyc) files are OK, they will be deleted by makebuild.bat
3) Execute the makebuild.bat from the root of Naali source checkout. This creates a "build" directory for NSIS
   to work from, with everything copied
4) Execute the NSIS script (viewer-installer.nsi) and let it package the Naali installer
5) Done, enjoy your new Naali package

When you make builds repeatedly, only steps 3) & 4) have to be repeated, unless dependencies change.
