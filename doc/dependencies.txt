Linux
------------------------------------------------

See your distribution's software repository.

Windows
------------------------------------------------

If you don't have 32-bit Windows as an OS, don't use the direct links.

gtkmm  ->  Website: http://www.gtkmm.org/
       ->  Installer: http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gtkmm/2.14/gtkmm-win32-devel-2.14.3-2.exe
       ->  Get 2.14.x or never. Remember to get the "devel" version.
       ->  Be sure that install option "Add the gtkmm runtime directory to the PATH variable" is checked
	   
cmake  ->  Website: http://www.cmake.org/
       ->  Installer: http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.6/cmake-2.6.4-win32-x86.exe
       ->  You should select "Add CMake to the system PATH" when the installer asks for it.
	   
external librarys

    You can do this in two ways:
	
	1. BINARIES
	
       ->  Website: http://dev.realxtend.org/svn/viewerdeps
       ->  Direct link: http://dev.realxtend.org/gf/download/frsrelease/102/19/Dependencies_VS2008.zip
       1.  Extract the "bin" and "external_libs" from the .zip file to your <project_folder>/trunk folder.
       2.  Windows will probably prompt that you are extracting a "bin" folder that already exist. Just allow windows to continue the operation.
       3.  Set a new Windows System Variable named "REX_DEP_PATH" and set it to the "<project_folder>/trunk/external_libs" folder.
