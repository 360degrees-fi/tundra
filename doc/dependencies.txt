external libraries

    You can do this in two ways:
	
	1. BINARIES

       -> Website: http://dev.realxtend.org/gf/project/viewerdeps/scmsvn/?action=browse&path=%2Fbin%2Fwindows%2F
       -> SVN checkout: http://dev.realxtend.org/svn/viewerdeps/bin/windows
       1. Copy the bin directory from <dep_checkout_folder> to your viewer <project_folder>/trunk folder.
       2. Windows will probably prompt that you are copying to a "bin" folder that already exists. Just allow windows to continue the operation.
       3. Set a new Windows System Variable named "NAALI_DEP_PATH" and set it to <dep_checkout_folder>
           Help to do this
           - Windows XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310519 
           - Vista: Right Click "My Computer" on your desktop -> Properties -> Left side "Advanced system settings" -> "Enviroment Variables..."
       4. Qt is not included in the svn due to its size. See the file build_qt_windows.txt for options.


    2. SOURCE
	
       -> Website: http://dev.realxtend.org/gf/project/viewerdeps/scmsvn/
	   -> SVN checkout: http://dev.realxtend.org/svn/viewerdeps/trunk

	   NOTE: If you use the source method you will have to install boost and poco separately. URLs for this are on top of this document.
