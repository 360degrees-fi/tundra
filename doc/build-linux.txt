Most of Linux distributions
---------------------------

Viewer code uses many external libraries which are needed download/install/build before 
code itself can be build. Current used external libraries are listed in 
depencies.txt-file (note you don't need to download MD5). Most of libraries are found from your distribution 
repositories so don't panic. 

Current build system is CMake, which can be found from your linux distribution own repository. 
For use of CMake I suggest that you use cmake-gui -software.  

For cmake-gui users: 

1. Choose source code, example:  /my/path/to/code/viewer 
2. Choose location where binaries are build,  example: /my/path/to/build/directory
2.1 Choose view from Simple view to Groupped view (more informative)  
3. Hit the configure button, verify that all external libraries are found
4. After successful configuration hit the Generate button which will create actual Makefile which 
is located in your build directory. 
5. Go to your build directory and run $ make  

For plain cmake users: 

1. Run $ cmake .   ( in viewer code directory)
2. Assure that cmake found all external libraries 
3. Run $ make  

Known problems: 

1. If compiling crashes to " ..relocation R_X86_64_32 against `a local symbol' " or something 
assure that all your statically linked external libraries are compiled with -fPIC flag OR 
change statical libraries to shared versions. You can to that example choosing which library is used to change values
of library paths in cmake-gui example: libMy.a -file to corresponding libMy.so-file.  

2. Remember to change linux-plugins.cfg file to point current location of your OGRE plugins 
(it can be example /usr/local/lib/OGRE)

3. Remember that viewer searches plugins and configuration files 
to load from it own current directory this means that your folder where 
viewer executable lies has to have next folders and files: 

data/  media/ modules/ plugins.cfg  plugins-unix.cfg  pymodules  resources.cfg  testing 


Fedora
------
1. Compile latest boost from source
2. Compile Poco from source
3. Run $ REX_DEP_PATH=/opt/deps cmake .
* If prefix is /usr/local, run $ BOOST_ROOT=/usr/local cmake .
