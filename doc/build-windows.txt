- PoCo: Set the global VS environment settings to refer to the PoCo includes and libraries, or copy to ${REX_DEP_PATH}/PoCo/include & ${REX_DEP_PATH}/PoCo/libs
- Ogre: Set the global VS environment settings to refer to the Ogre includes and libraries, or copy to ${REX_DEP_PATH}/Ogre/include & ${REX_DEP_PATH}/Ogre/libs
- Gtkmm: Set the environment variable GTKMM_BASEPATH to point to the Gtkmm root.
