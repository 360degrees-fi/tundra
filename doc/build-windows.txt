Using the Pre-built Binaries
----------------------------

Includes the following: Boost, PoCo, Ogre3D, xmlrpcepi, libiconv2, libexpat
1. Copy the necessary  DLLs to the SVN bin/ directory.
2. Copy the includes and LIB files in external_dependencies to REX_DEP_PATH.

Configuring the Build
---------------------

- Boost: Set the global VS environment settings to refer to Boost includes and libraries, or copy to ${REX_DEP_PATH}/Boost/include & ${REX_DEP_PATH}/Boost/libs
- PoCo: Set the global VS environment settings to refer to the PoCo includes and libraries, or copy to ${REX_DEP_PATH}/PoCo/include & ${REX_DEP_PATH}/PoCo/libs
- Ogre: Set the global VS environment settings to refer to the Ogre includes and libraries, or copy to ${REX_DEP_PATH}/Ogre/include & ${REX_DEP_PATH}/Ogre/libs
- Gtkmm: Set the environment variable GTKMM_BASEPATH to point to the Gtkmm root.
- XMLRPC-EPI: XMLRPC-EPI depends on LibIconv and eXpat. To build this, first build the expat project. 

MAKE THE PROJECT FILE
---------------------

Go to your <project_folder>/trunk and execute the cmake.bat if you are not using VS2008, and cmake_vs2008.bat, if you are using VS2008.

If everything went right you should now have a Visual Studio project file in your <project_folder>/trunk. 
When compiling for the first time, compile in debug mode and run the exe at least once. Some data files are created in debug mode which are needed when running in release mode.
