Preparing Qt for use with Visual Studio 2008 and rex

This set of instructions is adapted from 
http://dcsoft.com/community_server/blogs/dcsoft/archive/2009/03/06/how-to-setup-qt-4-5-visual-studio-integration.aspx
(which was a bit outdated).

1. Download and install Qt LGPL http://www.qtsoftware.com/downloads
2. Double-check that C:\Qt\2009.02\qt\bin was added to your path.
3. Open VS2008 command prompt, go to C:\Qt\2009.02\qt\ and run 
     
      configure -platform win32-msvc2008

4. In the same directory, run

      nmake

5. Add QTDIR = C:\Qt\2009.02\qt\ to your environment variables.
6. Regenerate the rex VS project files from the cmake files. Remember to invoke cmake from a process that was created
   after steps 2 and 4 in order for the environment settings to take effect. This means restarting Visual Studio or
   any command prompts after changing the environment settings.
