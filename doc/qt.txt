Preparing Qt for use with Visual Studio 2008 and rex

This set of instructions is adapted from 
http://dcsoft.com/community_server/blogs/dcsoft/archive/2009/03/06/how-to-setup-qt-4-5-visual-studio-integration.aspx
(which was a bit outdated).

1. Download Qt source package from http://www.qtsoftware.com/downloads 
   Choose LGPL/Free -> Qt Framework only (Windows) -> Source code available on this link
   (direct link: http://get.qtsoftware.com/qt/source/qt-win-opensource-src-4.5.1.zip)

2. Extract zip to C: root. Rename the created directory to something more convenient, like Qt (assumed below)
3. Add C:\Qt\bin to your path
4. Open VS2008 command prompt, go to C:\Qt and run 
     
      configure -platform win32-msvc2008

5. In the same directory, run

      nmake

6. Add QTDIR = C:\Qt to your environment variables.
7. Regenerate the rex VS project files from the cmake files. Remember to invoke cmake from a process that was created
   after steps 3 and 6 in order for the environment settings to take effect. This means restarting Visual Studio or
   any command prompts after changing the environment settings.
