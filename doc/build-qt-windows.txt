Preparing Qt for use with Visual Studio 2008 and rex

This set of instructions is adapted from 
http://dcsoft.com/community_server/blogs/dcsoft/archive/2009/03/06/how-to-setup-qt-4-5-visual-studio-integration.aspx
(which was a bit outdated).

1. Download Qt source package from http://www.qtsoftware.com/downloads 
   Choose LGPL/Free -> Qt Framework only (Windows) -> Source code available on this link
   (direct link: http://get.qtsoftware.com/qt/source/qt-win-opensource-src-4.5.1.zip)

2. Extract zip to C: root. Rename the created directory to something more convenient, like Qt (assumed below)
3. Add C:\Qt\bin to your path
4. Open VS2008 command prompt, go to C:\Qt and run 
     
      configure -platform win32-msvc2008 -opensource -no-qt3support -dbus -I "%NAALI_DEP_PATH%\dbus\include" -L "%NAALI_DEP_PATH%\dbus\lib" -openssl -I "%NAALI_DEP_PATH%\OpenSSL\include" -L "%NAALI_DEP_PATH%\OpenSSL\lib"

        * note: if you encounter a link error in a moc-related object, you can try deleting the mocinclude.tmp file in that directory.

5. In the same directory, run

      nmake

6. Add QTDIR = C:\Qt to your environment variables.
7. Regenerate the rex VS project files from the cmake files. Remember to invoke cmake from a process that was created
   after steps 3 and 6 in order for the environment settings to take effect. This means restarting Visual Studio or
   any command prompts after changing the environment settings.


*  If configure and nmake doesn't work you can try to download built version of Qt SDK
   from: http://dev.realxtend.org/gf/project/viewerdeps/frs/

   Built was made on Windows Vista 32bit
   
   1) Download Qt.zip
   2) Unzip to c:\
      (ensure that folder structure is like below)
   3) set environment variable: QTDIR=C:\Qt\2009.02-visual-studio\qt
