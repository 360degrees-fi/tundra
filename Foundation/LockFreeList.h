/** Implements a linked list that has threadsafe inserts:
    - There's no inserts in-between, only push_backs (call Insert to do a push_back).
    - There are no functions that allow doing a delete/erase on the list nodes. Everything
      is freed once the list is destroyed.
    - Only one thread can act as a producer to this thread. This is the only thread
      that may call Insert().
    - The actual elements in the list are not protected in any way. Use mutexes manually
      if you need to shield the individual nodes.
    - There is no limitation on how many threads can read the list.
    
    Deliberately not following the naming of std::list so that there is no confusion that
    this doesn't operate like a standard list container. */
