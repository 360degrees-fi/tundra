Tundra-Android port, build instructions
---------------------------------------

Some dependencies will be automatically built, others need to be manually installed. See below for detail.


Windows
-------

- You will need the Android SDK & NDK, download and install them from http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html.
  Install API platform 10 (2.3.3) for the Native Activity support that OGRE library needs.

- Set the environment variables ANDROID_SDK & ANDROID_NDK to point to them, for example
  ANDROID_NDK=C:\android-ndk-r8
  ANDROID_SDK=C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk

- Using a Visual Studio command prompt, run BuildAndroidDps.cmd from the "android" subdirectory of Tundra checkout.
  This downloads and builds the automatically buildable dependencies (Bullet, Boost, kNet, OGRE.) This may take some time,
  so be patient.

- For Qt, the Necessitas SDK is used. Download and install it from http://necessitas.kde.org/necessitas/necessitas_sdk_installer.php,
  then manually copy the contents of its "Android\Qt\482\armeabi-v7a" subdirectory (which includes bin, include 
  and lib subdirectories) into the the subdirectory "deps-android\Qt" of the Tundra checkout.

- To build Tundra, run BuildTundra.cmd from the "android" subdirectory of Tundra checkout, using a Visual Studio command prompt.
