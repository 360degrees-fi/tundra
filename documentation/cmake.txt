To prepare or update system-specific build files with cmake, execute the command
	cmake . 

in the viewer root directory, which contains the top-level CMakeLists.txt file.

For Visual Studio 2008, it may be necessary to give the command 
	cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008"

The batch files cmake.bat and cmake_vs2008.bat also accomplish the same.

The CMakeLists files for individual subprojects (modules) find source files by wildcards (*.cpp *.h), so when new files are added, cmake only needs to be re-run to update the build files. When adding new subprojects, refer to existing CMakeLists files, and also add a corresponding add_subdirectory command to the top-level CMakeLists file.

For examples of executables, see rex & UnitTests subprojects.
For examples of static libraries, see Core & framework.
For examples of dynamic libraries, see GeometrySystem for instance.
