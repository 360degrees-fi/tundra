Tabs vs spaces:

Spaces, indentation 4


Include guards, example:

#ifndef __incl_CoreStdIncludes_h__
#define __incl_CoreStdIncludes_h__


Naming of stuff:

Class names in camelcase (ExampleClass)
Class member variables prefixed with m
Function names, local variables and parameters should start with lower case, then next words in camelcase, like unregisterService
Functions that should not be publically called prefixed with underscore
File names following the class names, using .cpp and .h extensions


Documentation:

Doxygen style, comment headers, not implementation
