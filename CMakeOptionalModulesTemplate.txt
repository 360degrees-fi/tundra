# In CMakeOptionalModules.txt you can configure which additional modules 
# are added to the build. Do not commit CMakeOptionalModules.txt into the 
# SVN repository! The idea is that everyone can customize the set of 
# modules to build using that file, without having to fear about an 
# accidental commit of these changes.

# CMakeOptionalModulesTemplate.txt is only a template file! Changes to that file
# do not have any effect on the actual CMake execution.

# The following modules are optional. You may
# leave out any of these, and the project should
# still build and work. If it doesn't, please
# report it as a bug.

#add_subdirectory (TestModule)
#add_subdirectory (UnitTests) #TODO: didn't compile on fedora
#add_subdirectory (DebugStats)
#add_subdirectory (NetTestLogicModule)
add_subdirectory (PythonModule)
add_subdirectory (CommunicationModule)
#add_subdirectory (OpenALAudioModule)
#add_subdirectory (RexCBLogin) # RexLogic::RexWebLogin replaces this atm anyways
#add_subdirectory (RexQtScriptModule)
