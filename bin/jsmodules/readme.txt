experimental javascript support.

now to run custom E-C component handlers loaded from servers.
apitest/ folder has example one(s) that are actually not loaded 
from the naali dir, but to be put to server, but are now here
so that get versioned alongside with the developing client side api.

was initially for testing running parts of intensityingine using qtscript in Naali. that is in antont's intensity branch on github - running unittests of the Action class there worked.
