 -- Install Murmur --

 - Windows - 
   Download the latest stable Win32 release http://sourceforge.net/projects/mumble/files/ .
   Start the installation, and when you come to the installation selection, select at least the Murmur server. 
   You can choose to install Mumble and Bonjour if you want, but it is not a requirement. 
   Once you have it installed, it is recommended that you make a shortcut to it in order to easily start it. 
   Go to C:\Program Files\Mumble (or wherever you installed Murmur to), right click on murmur.exe and click "Create Shortcut." 
   Find the shortcut (it will be in the same folder as murmur.exe), right click it, and click "Rename." Type "Murmur" (without the quotes) and press enter. 
   Now drag the Murmur icon onto your desktop.

 - Linux
   For nearly all Linux distributions, you can simply use the static binary. 
   However, if your specific distribution supports Murmur (such as Ubuntu), you should look into using the specific packages for it.
