/** UICanvas represents a rectangular-shaped 2D canvas on which Qt widgets can be placed. To support 
    proper headless execution mode and canvas compositing effects, clients should always use these 
    canvases as containers for their own widgets and never instantiate QWidgets as standalone windows.

    To add a widget to a canvas, allocate it dynamically and call UICanvas::AddWidget. UICanvas takes
    ownership of the widget memory and stores it to a QGraphicsScene. Do not create stack-allocated
    widgets.

    There are two main display modes a UICanvas can be initialized in: UICanvas::Internal and 
    UICanvas::External. In Internal mode, the canvas creates and maintains its own render surface to 
    which the canvas widgets are drawn on. This surface can then be shown in 2D with desktop 
    compositing effects (e.g. alpha fade), or used as a texture for a 3D object in the scene.

    In External mode, the canvas doesn't create a 3D texture surface, but just creates an external
    window that contains a QGraphicsView widget that displays the internal QGraphicsScene containing
    all the widgets that have been added to the UICanvas. This functionality is mostly intended for
    debugging, but can perhaps be useful in other cases as well.

    Currently changing the UICanvas display mode after the UICanvas has been instantiated is not supported. */
