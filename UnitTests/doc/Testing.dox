\page Testing_page Testing and unit tests

	All Core and Foundation classes should have corresponding unit tests.
	
\section unit_testing Unit tests

	Boost unit test framework is used for unit tests. The framework
	builds automatically a test runner in both debug and release mode,
	UnitTestsd.exe and UnitTests.exe respectively, located in the bin
	directory.
	
	It is recommended to run unit tests in both debug and release mode as
	there are some differences in the code between the two modes.
	
	There is no policy that mandates unit tests must pass before committing
	any changes, but running them at least should give you some peace of mind,
	and currently they don't take too long.

\section integration_testing Integration testing
	
	For more integration-type of tests, TestModule can be used. Of course
	normal integration testing should be done before committing any changes
	and to at least make sure the viewer doesn't crash in any of the build
	configuration modes during normal operation of the viewer.
